// The root module requires github.com/scylladb/gocql/lz4 so its integration suite can
// build LZ4Compressor, and the replace above brings that requirement into this module's
// graph -- but not the root's own `replace ... => ./lz4`, which applies only while the
// root is the main module. Without this second replace, `go mod tidy -C tests/bench`
// resolves the published release of a module that is sitting in the tree: it needs the
// network, and it computes this module's graph from the released lz4's requirements
// while the root computes from ./lz4.

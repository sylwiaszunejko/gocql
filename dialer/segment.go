// SegmentCompressor compresses and decompresses protocol v5 transport segment
// payloads.
//
// It is structurally identical to gocql.SegmentCompressor, and a value of that type
// satisfies this directly. It is redeclared rather than imported because this package
// does not depend on the driver, and because the only compressor that implements it —
// lz4 — lives in a separate module that the driver cannot construct for itself. A
// caller that wants compressed v5 recordings therefore has to hand one in.
//
// A nil SegmentCompressor means the uncompressed segment layout. Note that a typed
// nil is not nil as an interface, so pass an untyped nil rather than a nil variable
// of a concrete compressor type.

// SegmentSplitter recovers CQL frames from a protocol v5 transport-segment byte
// stream delivered in arbitrary chunks.
//
// From v5 the driver wraps each CQL frame in one or more segments: a header carrying
// a 17-bit payload length and a self-contained flag, a header CRC24, the payload
// (optionally compressed) and a payload CRC32. A segment is either self-contained,
// carrying one or more complete frames, or a link in a chain carrying a slice of one
// large frame.
//
// Recovering the frames needs no separate reassembly path for the two shapes. The
// spec (section 2) gives a split frame its own sequence of segments, so a chain never
// shares a segment with anything else, and the ordered concatenation of every
// payload is exactly the frame stream. Feeding that concatenation to a FrameSplitter,
// which already tolerates arbitrary chunk boundaries, therefore handles both several
// frames in one self-contained segment and a frame whose 9-byte header straddles a
// segment boundary.
//
// What concatenation alone loses is the ability to notice a stream that does not mean
// what it says, so the flag is checked rather than ignored — see Feed. Without those
// checks a corrupt or truncated chain does not fail, it silently re-aligns at the
// wrong offset and yields plausible garbage, which in a recording is worse than an
// error.
// The field order is dictated by the fieldalignment vet check, which wants the
// pointer-bearing fields contiguous, so it does not group them by what they do.

// Four rules govern the self-contained flag, and together they are what stops a
// damaged stream from re-aligning silently:
//
//   - A self-contained segment may not arrive while a chain is open. This is the same
//     rejection the driver's own reader makes, and the case that matters most: without
//     it an over-running chain does not error, it resumes reading frames at the wrong
//     offset.
//   - A self-contained segment must not end mid-frame. It promised whole frames.
//   - A chain segment must carry a non-empty payload once the chain is open, so a peer
//     cannot drive an endless chain. Two shapes the driver accepts are exempt, because
//     the splitter must not refuse a stream gocql itself handles: an empty
//     self-contained segment, and the first segment of a chain.
//   - A chain must yield exactly one frame and nothing after it, since a split frame
//     gets a sequence of segments to itself. A chain here is bounded by the frame it
//     carries, not by the run of continuation segments: the segment that completes a
//     frame ends the chain, so a following continuation segment begins a new one. That
//     matches the driver's own reader, which returns from recvSplitFrame as soon as the
//     frame is whole -- a chain of one segment included.
//
// A splitter is one-shot: any failure is remembered and returned by every later call,
// because a stream that has failed one of those rules cannot be resumed without
// re-feeding the bytes that failed.

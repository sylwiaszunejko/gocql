// lands on v4 (discoverProtocol) and v5 keeps the same header, so the 1-byte stream id

// is in doubt is worth failing loudly, while the replayer only asks whether a record is
// exactly one frame, which an absurd length answers on its own. A length that overflows

// middle of one, and either shape has to come back out as the frames that went in.
// The write side happens to deliver one frame per call today, but only by accident
// of how net.Buffers.WriteTo dispatches (see the note in the replayer), so it is fed
// through here too rather than trusting that.

// than frames. A SegmentSplitter unwraps those first and feeds their payloads here;
// this type is only ever handed a CQL frame stream.

// connection (both of the recorder's decoders, the replayer's request decoder, and the
// splitter inside a SegmentSplitter), so an outlier is handed back instead. The driver
// does the same for its own framer buffers, which it releases and reallocates rather

//
// A frame is emitted before the bytes that follow it are looked at, so a caller that
// stops at the first error stops with the stream positioned exactly after the frame
// that failed.
//
// A splitter is one-shot: any failure, including one returned by emit, is remembered
// and returned by every later call. There is no resuming a stream whose framing is in
// doubt — a recording assembled past a failure is worthless, and the alternative is
// worse than useless. A frame that fails in emit is complete but unrecorded, and the
// obvious "leave it buffered for a retry" leaves the splitter owing zero body bytes,
// so the next call would consume nothing, emit that same frame a second time, and
// write it into the recording twice.
// "Every later call" includes one with nothing in it. consume is where the latch is
// normally read, and it does not run when there is nothing to consume, so an empty
// buffer would otherwise come back nil and read as a healthy stream — which is how
// ConnectionReplayer.Write, the one caller with no failure gate of its own, would
// answer a zero-length write after ObserveRequest had already refused the connection.

		// behind FrameBodyLen's completeness test, the one shape this package most
		// needs to refuse is the one shape it would never see. Feed would answer nil
		// for it, the recorder would forward it to the server and record nothing (its
		// Write gates the socket on the recording), and the replayer would report a
		// successful write and then block in Read on a response it never queued. Nor
		// is that shape exotic: OPTIONS carries no body, and the control connection
		// heartbeats one every 30 seconds.
		//
		// Everything below reads the v3+ layout: the body length comes from
		// frame[5:9], which on v1/v2 is the tail of the length plus the first body
		// byte, and the recorder goes on to take a 2-byte stream id from frame[2:4].
		// Refusing beats slicing, so a caller-pinned old protocol fails by name
		// instead of recording mis-framed garbage. The refusal also precedes the
		// length check because on such a frame the length is not the peer's number at
		// all, and naming it would send the reader after the wrong thing.
		//
		// Latching on the response direction too costs the driver its protocol
		// downgrade on a recorded connection: controlConn.discoverProtocol reads the
		// server's version out of the ERROR frame answering a too-new STARTUP, and a
		// v1/v2-stamped one now fails the read rather than reaching
		// parseProtocolFromError. That is the trade, not an oversight -- the frames it

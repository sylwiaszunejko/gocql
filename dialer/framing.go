// Framing tracks how one connection's bytes are framed, and hands out a decoder per
// direction.
//
// Up to a point in the handshake both directions carry bare CQL frames. Past it, on
// protocol v5, both carry transport segments. The frame bytes do not say which side of
// that line they are on, and on a compressed connection they do not say how large a
// segment header is either, so both facts are latched from the handshake as it goes
// past.
//
// # Where the line is
//
// It is one frame earlier than "the handshake finished", which is the detail worth
// being careful about: getting it wrong by a single frame corrupts every authenticated
// recording.
//
// The driver sets its startupCompleted flag as soon as READY *or* AUTHENTICATE is
// received, and then writes AUTH_RESPONSE through the same gate that decides whether to
// segment. So authentication happens after the switch, not before it:
//
//	driver writes, unsegmented:  OPTIONS, STARTUP
//	driver writes, segmented:    AUTH_RESPONSE onward
//	server writes, unsegmented:  SUPPORTED, READY | AUTHENTICATE
//	server writes, segmented:    AUTH_SUCCESS | AUTH_CHALLENGE onward
//
// native_protocol_v5.spec section 2.3.1 says the same: after sending READY or
// AUTHENTICATE in response to a STARTUP, the server begins framing everything further.
//
// # Why no read or write can straddle it
//
// The switch is driven by a response frame, and observed by both directions, so it has
// to be impossible for a single Read or Write to contain bytes from both sides of it.
//
// On the read side the server sends nothing after READY or AUTHENTICATE until the
// client's next request, so the bytes carrying that frame cannot also carry the first
// segment. On the write side the startup coordinator is strictly
// request-response-request, so AUTH_RESPONSE is written only after AUTHENTICATE was
// read, by which time the latch has flipped.
//
// # Concurrency
//
// A connection's reads and writes run on different goroutines — the driver's serve()
// loop and whichever goroutine is executing a query — so the latches are atomic. The
// decoders are not: each belongs to one direction, and is only ever touched by that
// direction's goroutine.

//
//   - Compression below protocol v5, which compresses frame *bodies* rather than

//     to find a response for a request it has. Supporting it means decompressing frame
//     bodies, which is a different feature from segment compression.
//   - An algorithm that is not the one the supplied compressor implements. The segment
//     CRCs cover the compressed payload, so they pass either way and the mismatch
